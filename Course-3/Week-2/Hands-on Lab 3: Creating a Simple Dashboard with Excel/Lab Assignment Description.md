In this lab, you will learn how to setup and configure a relatively simple dashboard in Excel, which will help you tell a story about the data.

## Software Used in this Lab
The instruction videos in this course use the full Excel Desktop version as this has all the available product features, but for the hands-on labs we will be using the free ‘Excel for the web’ version as this is available to everyone.

Although you can use the Excel Desktop software if you have access to this version, it is recommended that you use Excel for the web for the hands-on labs as the lab instructions specifically refer to this version, and there are some small differences in the interface and available features.^^ If you do not yet have access to Excel for the Web, you can follow the instructions in the following lab to get started with it: Hands-on Lab: Introduction to Excel for the web.

^^ In this lab, to do all the steps you need Excel Desktop, but you can use Excel for the web and just miss out the steps in Exercise 1 Steps 13 to 22.
