## Software Used in this Assignment
The hands-on lab in this assignment will use the trial version of Cognos Analytics from IBM.

## Dataset Used in this Assignment
The dataset used in this lab comes from here in the IBM Accelerator Catalog. The Terms of use for such are located at https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/.

We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully, please use the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.

# Assignment Scenario
As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships you need to build out a dashboard to allow you to understand your sales and service departments.

## Accessing the Dataset for this Final Assignment
The dataset used in this final assignment is provided as sample data within your Cognos environment, in a data module called Auto group data module.

To load and open the data module:

1. On the navigation panel of Cognos Analytics, select Team content.
2. Now go to By industry > Automotive > Data.
3. Here the sample data used in this final assignment can be found, in a data module called Auto group data module. Right-click on Auto group data module and select Create Dashboard.

## Guidelines for the Submission
Use the course videos and hands-on lab from Module 2 Lesson 2 Creating Dashboards Using IBM Cognos Analytics to help you complete the following tasks:

Create two dashboards as follows:

- One dashboard using the tabbed template that has 4 small rectangles at the top and a large rectangle below - rename this dashboard tab to Sales.
- One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template - rename this dashboard tab to Service.

**Capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:**

1. On the Sales dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics:

- In the first small rectangle (Panel 1), capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
- In the second small rectangle (Panel 2), capture Quantity sold
- In the third small rectangle (Panel 3), capture Quantity sold by model (as a bar chart)
- In the fourth small rectangle (Panel 4), capture Average quantity sold

2. On the Sales dashboard in the large rectangle (Panel 5), display Profit by Dealer ID as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.

3. On the Service dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
- In the top left area (Panel 1), capture the number of recalls per model of car (as a column chart)
- In the top right area (Panel 2), capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews (as a treemap)
- In the bottom left area (Panel 3), capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit (as a line and column chart).
- In the bottom right area (Panel 4), capture the number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map). This will help us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.

4. To export your dashboard as a PDF, follow instructions below:
- On the application toolbar of your dashboard page, click Share icon.
- On the Export tab, check Include filters and click Export.
- On the Print pop-up page, in the Destination drop-down list, select Save as PDF.
- Save the PDF file on your local machine to any location you like (preferably your Downloads folder) for later upload and submission to the coursera platform.
