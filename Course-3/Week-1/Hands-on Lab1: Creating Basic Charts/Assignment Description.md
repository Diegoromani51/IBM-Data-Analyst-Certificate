In this lab, you will learn how to create some basic charts in Excel. First, we will look at how to create a column chart and then an area chart. Next, we will learn how to create a bar chart and a line chart from a pivot table.

## Software Used in this Lab
The instruction videos in this course use the full Excel Desktop version as this has all the available product features, but for the hands-on labs we will be using the free ‘Excel for the web’ version as this is available to everyone.

Although you can use the Excel Desktop software if you have access to this version, it is recommended that you use Excel for the web for the hands-on labs as the lab instructions specifically refer to this version, and there are some small differences in the interface and available features. If you do not yet have access to Excel for the Web, you can follow the instructions in the following lab to get started with it: Hands-on Lab: Introduction to Excel for the web.

## Dataset Used in this Lab
The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/gagandeep16/car-sales under a CC0: Public Domain license. We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully, please use the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.
