# Hands-on Lab: Using Views in MySQL using phpMyAdmin
**Estimated time needed**: 20 minutes

In this lab, you will learn about using views. In SQL, a view is an alternative way of representing data that exists in one or more tables. Just like a real table, it contains rows and columns. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. Though views can be queried like a table, views are dynamic; only the definition of the view is stored, not the data.

## Software Used in this Lab
In this lab, you will use MySQL. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve data.
To complete this lab you will utilize MySQL relational database service available as part of IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) Cloud IDE. SN Labs is a virtual lab environment used in this course.

# Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a View and show a selection of data for a given table
- Update a View to combine two or more tables in meaningful ways
- Drop a created View
