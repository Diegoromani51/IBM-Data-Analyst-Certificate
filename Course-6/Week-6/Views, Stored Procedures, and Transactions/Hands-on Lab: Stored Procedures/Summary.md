# Hands-on Lab: Stored Procedures
**Estimated time needed**: 20 minutes

Stored Procedures in SQL are a type of database object that allow you to encapsulate a series of SQL statements into a single routine. They are stored in the database data dictionary and can be invoked from an application program or from the database command interface. Stored procedures can accept input parameters and return multiple values of output parameters. They can also include control-of-flow constructs such as loops and conditional statements. Stored procedures offer several benefits including improved performance, higher productivity, ease of use, and increased scalability. They also provide a mechanism for enforcing business rules and data integrity in the database system.
