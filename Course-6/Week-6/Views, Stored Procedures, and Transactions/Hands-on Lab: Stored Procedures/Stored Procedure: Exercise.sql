-- Stored Procedure: Exercise 1
-- In this exercise, you will create and execute a stored procedure to read data from a table on mysql phpadmin using SQL.

-- 1. You will create a stored procedure routine named RETRIEVE_ALL.
-- This RETRIEVE_ALL routine will contain an SQL query to retrieve all the records from the PETSALE table, so you don't need to write the same query over and over again. You just call the stored procedure routine to execute the query everytime.
-- To create the stored procedure routine, copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go.
 DELIMITER //

 CREATE PROCEDURE RETRIEVE_ALL()

 BEGIN
    SELECT *  FROM PETSALE;
 END //
 DELIMITER ;

-- 2. To call the RETRIEVE_ALL routine, open another SQL tab by clicking Open in new Tab
-- Delete the default line which appears so that you will get a blank window.
 CALL RETRIEVE_ALL;

-- 3. You can view the created stored procedure routine RETRIEVE_ALL. On the left panel, expand the mysql option. 
-- Click on Procedures then click on the RETRIEVE_ALL and view the procedure.
-- 4. If you wish to drop the stored procedure routine RETRIEVE_ALL, copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go.
 DROP PROCEDURE RETRIEVE_ALL;

 CALL RETRIEVE_ALL;

-- Stored Procedure: Exercise 2
-- In this exercise, you will create and execute a stored procedure to write/modify data in a table on MySQL using SQL.

-- You will create a stored procedure routine named UPDATE_SALEPRICE with parameters Animal_ID and Animal_Health.
-- This UPDATE_SALEPRICE routine will contain SQL queries to update the sale price of the animals in the PETSALE table depending on their health conditions, BAD or WORSE.
-- This procedure routine will take animal ID and health conditon as parameters which will be used to update the sale price of animal in the PETSALE table by an amount depending on their health condition. Suppose that:
-- For animal with ID XX having BAD health condition, the sale price will be reduced further by 25%.
-- For animal with ID YY having WORSE health condition, the sale price will be reduced further by 50%.
-- For animal with ID ZZ having other health condition, the sale price won't change.
-- To create the stored procedure routine, copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go.

-- 1. Let's call the UPDATE_SALEPRICE routine. We want to update the sale price of animal with ID 1 having BAD health condition in the PETSALE table. open another SQL tab by clicking Open in new Tab
-- Delete the default line which appears so that you will get a blank window.
-- Copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. Click Go.
   CALL RETRIEVE_ALL;

   CALL UPDATE_SALEPRICE(1, 'BAD');

   CALL RETRIEVE_ALL;

-- 2. Let's call the UPDATE_SALEPRICE routine once again. We want to update the sale price of animal with ID 3 having WORSE health condition in the PETSALE table. copy the code below and paste it to the textarea of the SQL page. 
-- Click Go. You will have all the records retrieved from the PETSALE table.
   CALL RETRIEVE_ALL;

   CALL UPDATE_SALEPRICE(3, 'WORSE');

   CALL RETRIEVE_ALL;

-- 3. You can view the created stored procedure routine UPDATE_SALEPRICE. Click on the Routines and view the procedure.
