Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- A join combines the rows from two or more tables based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.

- To combine data from three or more different tables, you simply add new joins to the SQL statement. 

- There are two types of table joins: inner join and outer join; and three types of outer joins: left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join. 

- The most common type of join is the inner join, which matches the results from two tables and returns only the rows that match.

- You can use an alias as shorthand for a table or column name.

- You can use a self-join to compare rows within the same table.
