# Task 2 : Create tables using SQL script
In this exercise, you will learn how to execute a script containing the CREATE TABLE commands for all the tables rather than create each table manually by typing the DDL commands in the SQL editor.

Follow the steps shared below.

- Download the script file to your local machine:
- CVD_Database_Create_Tables_Script.sql
- Select the CVD database. Then click the Import tab.
- Click Choose File, browse for the file and upload it.
- Once uploaded, scroll down and click Go.
- The script then gets executed successfully.
- Click any of the tables to see its Table Definition (its list of columns, data types, and so on).

# Task 3 : Load data into tables
You now need to load the data to the tables. You could manually insert each row into the table one by one, but that is highly inefficient. Instead, MySQL (and almost every other database) lets you load data from CSV files directly to the tables.
The steps below explain loading data into the tables you created in Task 2.
1. Download the 5 CSV files below to your local machine.
   - https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX031EN/PATIENTS.csv
   - https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX031EN/MEDICAL_HISTORY.csv
   - https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX031EN/MEDICAL_PROCEDURES.csv
   - https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX031EN/MEDICAL_DEPARTMENTS.csv
   - https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX031EN/MEDICAL_LOCATIONS.csv

The steps to load a CSV to a table are as follows.

- Select the table.

- Click the Import tab.

- Browse to the location of the CSV file and click ‘Go’ to load the CSV file.
