# Hands-on Lab: Create and Load Tables using SQL Scripts
**Estimated time needed**: 20 minutes

In this lab, you will learn how to create tables and load data using the phpMyAdmin graphical user interface (GUI) tool in the MySQL database service.

## MySQL
In this lab, you will use MySQL. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve data.
To complete this lab, you will use MySQL relational database service available as part of IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) Cloud IDE, the virtual lab environment used in this course.

##  Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to use phpMyAdmin with MySQL to:

- Create a database on MySQL
- Create tables using SQL scripts
- Load data into tables directly from CSV files

# Database Used in this Lab
The database used in this lab is internal. You will be working on a sample Cardio-Vascular Diseases (CVD) database. This CVD database schema consists of five tables: PATIENTS, MEDICAL_HISTORY, MEDICAL_PROCEDURES, MEDICAL_DEPARTMENTS, and MEDICAL_LOCATIONS.
Your task is to create this database in MySQL. This task is divided into three parts.

Task 1: Create the database on MySQL using the phpMyAdmin GUI.

Task 2: Create all the tables in MySQL using an SQL script.

Task 3: Populate each table with the data in respective CSV files.
