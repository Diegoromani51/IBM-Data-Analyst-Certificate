In this module, you will explore the fundamental concepts behind databases, tables, and the relationships between them. You will then create an instance of a database, discover SQL statements that allow you to create and manipulate tables, and then practice them on your own live database.
# Learning Objectives
- Compose and execute CREATE TABLE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE statements hands-on on a live database.
- Create a database instance on the Cloud.
- Describe basic relational database concepts including tables, primary keys and foreign keys.
- Compare and contrast Data Definition Language and Data Manipulation Language.
- Develop ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE statements.
- Explain the syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement.


## Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- A database is a repository of data that provides functionality for adding, modifying, and querying the data. 
- SQL is a language used to query or retrieve data from a relational database. 
- The Relational Model is the most used data model for databases because it allows for data independence. 
- The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each tuple or row, preventing duplication of data and providing a way of defining relationships between tables. 
- SQL statements fall into two different categories: Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
