# Hands-on Lab : COUNT, DISTINCT, LIMIT
**Estimated time needed**: 35 minutes

In this lab, you will learn a few useful expressions that are used with SELECT statements. First, you will learn COUNT, which is an aggregate function that retrieves the number of rows that matches the query criteria. Next, you will learn DISTINCT, which is used to remove duplicate values from a specified result set and only return the unique values. Lastly, you will learn LIMIT, which is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the table.
