# Hands-on Lab: Working with Multiple Tables

**Estimated time needed**: 20 minutes

## Software used in this lab
In this lab, you will use MySQL. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently.
To complete this lab, you will utilize MySQL relational database service available as part of IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) Cloud IDE. SN Labs is a virtual lab environment used in this course.

## Database used in this lab
The database used in this lab is internal. You will be working on a sample HR database. This HR database schema consists of 5 tables called EMPLOYEES, JOB_HISTORY, JOBS, DEPARTMENTS and LOCATIONS. Each table has a few rows of sample data. The following diagram shows the tables for the HR database:

# Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Write SQL queries that access more than one table
- Compose queries that access multiple tables using a nested statement in the WHERE clause
- Build queries with multiple tables in the FROM clause
- Write Implicit Join queries with join criteria specified in the WHERE clause
- Specify aliases for table names and qualify column names with table aliases

In this lab, you will complete SQL practice problems that will provide hands-on experience with SQL queries that access multiple tables. You will be:

- Accessing Multiple Tables with Sub-Queries
- Accessing Multiple Tables with Implicit Joins
