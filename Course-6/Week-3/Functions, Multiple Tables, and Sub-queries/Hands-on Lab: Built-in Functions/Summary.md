# Hands-on Lab: Built-in Functions
**Estimated time needed**: 20 minutes

In SQL, you can access many built-in functions that may be used to get more variety in our data analysis. These functions include aggregation functions (like MAX, MIN, SUM, and AVG), string functions (like LENGTH, UCASE, and LCASE), scalar functions (like ROUND), and a variety of date functions as well. In this tab, you'll get hands-on practice on how to use all of them.

## Software Used in this Lab
In this lab, you will use MySQL. MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently.
To complete this lab, you will use MySQL relational database service available as part of IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) Cloud IDE. SN Labs is a virtual lab environment used in this course

# Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to compose queries in phpMyAdmin with MySQL using:

- Aggregation Functions
- Scalar Functions
- String Functions
- Date Functions
