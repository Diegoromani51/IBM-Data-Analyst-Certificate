Advanced visualization tools are sophisticated platforms that provide a wide range of advanced features and capabilities. These tools provide an extensive set of options that help create visually appealing and interactive visualizations. In this module, you will learn about waffle charts and word cloud including their application. You will explore Seaborn, a new visualization library in Python, and learn how to create regression plots using it. In addition, you will learn about folium, a data visualization library that visualizes geospatial data. Furthermore, you will explore the process of creating maps using Folium and superimposing them with markers to make them interesting. Finally, you will learn how to create a Choropleth map using Folium.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe Choropleth maps with the help of an illustration
- Explore the process of superimposing markers on maps using Foilum
- Describe Folium and explore the process of creating maps
- Describe Seaborn and explore the process of generating attractive regression plots
- Explore waffle charts and word cloud along with their application
- Explore the process of creating a Choropleth map using Folium


## Summary: Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Folium is a data visualization library in Python that helps people visualize geospatial data. 

- With Folium, you can create maps of different styles, such as street-level maps, stamen maps, and more. 

- A feature of Folium is that you can create different map styles using the tiles parameter.

- With Folium, you can easily add markers on maps.

- The ‘location’ parameter specifies the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center point of the map.

- Markers play a vital role in enhancing interactivity and adding context to maps.

- The folium.Marker() function specifies location parameters.

- The popup parameter provides a label upon being clicked.

- Markers can be created using “feature group.”

- A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable.

- When creating a choropleth map, Folium requires a GeoJson file that includes geospatial data of the region.

- The Mapbox Bright Tileset displays the name of every country when used on a map.
