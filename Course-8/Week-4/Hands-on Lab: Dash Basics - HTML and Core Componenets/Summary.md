# Dash Components
## Objectives
After completing the lab you will be able to:

- Create a dash application layout
- Add HTML H1, P, and Div components
- Add core graph component
- Add multiple charts
  
**Estimated time needed**: 30 minutes

## Dataset Used
Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance dataset from Data Asset eXchange


# Let's start creating dash application

## Goal
Create a dashboard that displays the percentage of flights running under specific distance group. Distance group is the distance intervals, every 250 miles, for flight segment. If the flight covers to 500 miles, it will be under distance group 2 (250 miles + 250 miles).

## Expected Output
Below is the expected result from the lab. Our dashboard application consists of three components:

- Title of the application
- Description of the application
- Chart conveying the proportion of distance group by month

## To do:
1. Import required libraries and read the dataset
2. Create an application layout
3. Add title to the dashboard using HTML H1 component
4. Add a paragraph about the chart using HTML P component
5. Add the pie chart above using core graph component
6. Run the app
