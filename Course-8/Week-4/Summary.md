Dashboards and interactive data applications are crucial tools for data visualization and analysis because they provide a consolidated view of key data and metrics in a visually appealing and understandable format. In this module, you will explore the benefits of dashboards and identify the different web-based dashboarding tools in Python. You will learn about Plotly and discover how to use Plotly graph objects and Plotly express to create charts. You will gain insight into Dash, an open-source user interface Python library, and its two components. Finally, you will gain a clear understanding of the callback function and determine how to connect core and HTML components using callback.
# Learning Objectives
- Discover Dash and its two components
- Identify different web-based dashboarding tools available in Python
- Use Plotly graph objects and Plotly express to create charts
- Explore Plotly and its two sub-modules
- Determine the process of connecting core and HTML components using callback
- Describe the callback function

## Summary: Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Dash is an Open-Source User Interface Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications.

- It is easy to build Graphical User Interfaces using Dash as it abstracts all technologies required to make the applications.

- There are two components of Dash: Core and HTML components.

- The dash_core_components describe higher-level interactive components generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library.

- The dash_html_components library has a component for every HTML tag.

- A callback function is a python function that is automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes.

- The @app.callback decorator decorates the callback function in order to tell Dash to call it whenever there is a change in the input component value.

- The callback function takes input and output components as parameters and performs operations to return the desired result for the output component.
