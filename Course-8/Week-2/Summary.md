Visualization tools play a crucial role in data analysis and communication. These are essential for extracting insights and presenting information in a concise manner to both technical and non-technical audiences. In this module, you will create a diverse range of plots using Matplotlib, the data visualization library. Throughout this module, you will learn about area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots. You will also explore the process of creating these visualization tools using Matplotlib.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe a box plot with an illustration and create it using Matplotlib
- Explore an area plot with an illustration and create it using Matplotlib
- Define a histogram with an illustration and create it using Matplotlib
- Describe a bar chart with an illustration and create it using Matplotlib
- Discover a pie chart with an illustration and create it using Matplotlib
- Discover a scatter plot with an illustration and create it using Matplotlib


## Summary: Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

- A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into segments, to illustrate numerical proportion.

- The process of creating a pie chart involves importing Matplotlib to represent a large set of data over a period of time.

- A box plot is a way of statistically representing given data distribution through five main dimensions.

- The five main dimensions are minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

- You can create a box plot using Matplotlib.

- A scatter plot displays values pertaining to typically two variables against each other.

- The process of creating a scatter plot involves importing Matplotlib to visualize a large set of data.

- Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that offers a flexible interface for creating various types of plots.

- Matplotlib’s Pyplot module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.

- Data Storytelling is the ‘art of storytelling’ that involves creating a narrative around the data.

- Data visualization is an important aspect of data storytelling and involves creating engaging visuals.
