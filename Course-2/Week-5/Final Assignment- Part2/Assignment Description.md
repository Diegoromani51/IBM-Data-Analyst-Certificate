# Peer-Graded Assignment: Final Assignment – Part 2

## Software Used in this Assignment
The instruction videos in this course use the full Excel Desktop version as this has all the available product features, but for the hands-on labs we will be using the free ‘Excel for the web’ version as this is available to everyone.

Although you can use the Excel Desktop software if you have access to this version, it is recommended that you use Excel for the web for the hands-on labs as the lab instructions specifically refer to this version, and there are some small differences in the interface and available features.

## Dataset Used in this Assignment
The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr under a Public Domain license.

We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully please use the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.

## Assignment Scenario
In this final assigment, you will be following the scenario of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked with sorting and analyzing fleet inventory data that was previously imported and cleaned. You plan to use pivot tables to analyze the data in preparation for the results to be visualized in a dashboard and added to a data findings report later.
