- You can format both cells and data in Excel. 

- A formula is made up of several component parts, and formulas can perform calculations using numbers directly or by using references to data in the worksheet. 

- You can use the Fill Handle in Excel to quickly copy formulas to other cells. 

- There are several different categories of function you can use for different purposes, and you can search for a function by name, or by category. 

- You can reference cells in the worksheet in your formulas by using relative, absolute, or mixed references.
