# Data Analysis Basics, Filtering and Sorting Data

In this lesson, you have learned the following information: 

Before shaping your data, you need to visualize the final output, and ask yourself the following questions: 

- How big is the dataset? 

- What type of filtering is required to find the necessary information? 

- How should the data be sorted? 

- What type of calculations are needed? 

There are several advantages to formatting your data as a table: 

- Automatic calculations even when filtering 

- Column headings never disappear 

- Banded rows to make reading easier 

- Tables will automatically expand when adding new rows 

The most basic way of shaping your data is to sort and filter it:

- Sorting data helps you to organize it by a specified criteria, such as numerically, alphabetically, or chronologically. 

- Filtering our data makes it easier to control what data is displayed and what is hidden, based on filtered fields. 

Excel Functions:

- Functions in Excel are arranged into multiple categories; including mathematical, statistical, logical, financial, and date and time-based. 

-Common functions for a data analyst include IF, IFS, COUNTIF, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP 

# Using Pivot Tables

In this lesson, you have learned the following information: 

Pivot Tables:

- To obtain usable and presentable insights into your data you need to use Pivot Tables. 

- Pivot tables provide a simple and quick way to summarize and analyze data, to observe trends and patterns in your data and to make comparisons of your data. 

- Pivot tables are dynamic, so as you change and add data to the original dataset on which the pivot table is based, the analysis and summary information changes too. 

- A Data Analyst can use pivot tables to draw useful and relevant conclusions about, and create insights into, an organizationâ€™s data in order to present those insights to interested parties within the company. 

Use this Pivot Table checklist to ensure your data is in a fit state to make a Pivot Table: 

- Format your data as a table for best results.

- Ensure column headings are correct, and there is only one header row, as these column headings become the field names in a Pivot Table.

- Remove any blank rows and columns, and try to eliminate blank cells also.

- Ensure value fields are formatted as numbers, and not text, and ensure date fields are formatted as dates, and not text.

Arranging Pivot Tables with Filters and Recommended Tables:

- You use the Pivot Table Fields pane to add and arrange data fields in your pivot table. 

- Recommended Pivot Tables are a list of suggested different combinations of data that could be used when creating a Pivot Table, based on the data selected in the worksheet. 

Filters and Slicers:

- Slicers are on-screen graphical filter objects that enable you to filter your data using buttons, which makes it easier to perform quick filtering of your pivot table data. 

- Timelines are another type of filter tool that enable you to filter specifically on date-related data in your pivot table. This is a much quicker and more effective way of dynamically filtering by date, rather than having to create and adjust filters on your date columns.
